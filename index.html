            Sass is a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or
            compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). Sass adds features such
            as variables, nested rules, mixins, and functions, and it helps to
            keep large stylesheets well-organized. The official website of Sass
            is a great resource for learning the language and its features and
            best practices.
